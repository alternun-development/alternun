# Introduction

Welcome to the **Craft the Future** Contest by Alternun! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

![Craft the Future](/img/craft-the-future.jpeg)

At Alternun.io, an innovative startup dedicated to the tokenization of real assets, we believe in the power of art to tell stories and communicate our mission. Thatâ€™s why we are launching this contest to invite artists to create unique pieces that graphically and strikingly reflect how we operate and what motivates us.

**What is our mission?**  
Our goal is to democratize access to investments in gold reserves through blockchain technology, making these opportunities accessible to everyone. We want artists to translate this concept into digital artworks that not only inspire but also educate about the potential of tokenization.

### Contest Details
- **Call for Entries Start**: October 15 - November 3 
- **Public Voting Week**: November 4 - November 8

We have a total budget of $350 USD to reward three artists, and $170 USD to reward 17 artist from the community through social engange via Zealy.
