# Introduction

Welcome to the **Craft the Future** by Alternun! ðŸŽ¨âœ¨

![Craft the Future](/img/hero-en.jpg)

Alternun is an innovative startup dedicated to the tokenization of real-world assets, focusing on gold. We believe in the power of art to tell stories and communicate our mission. Thatâ€™s why we are launching this contest to invite artists to create unique pieces that graphically and strikingly reflect how we operate and what motivates us.

**What is our mission?**  
Our goal is to democratize access to investments in gold reserves through blockchain technology, making these opportunities accessible to everyone. Alternun transforms gold mining reserves into a secure store of value that generates liquidity while preventing environmental harm through the application of regenerative finance. By tokenizing unexploited mining reserves, Alternun promotes a sustainable economy that benefits investors, communities, and the planet. We want artists to translate this concept into digital artworks that not only inspire but also educate about the potential of tokenization.

### Contest Details
- **Call for Entries Start**: October 15 - November 8 
- **Public Voting Week**: November 11 - November 15
- **Winners Announcement**: November 15

We have a total budget of $350 USD to reward three artists, and $170 USD to reward 17 artists from the community through social engagement via Zealy.

Join us in this exciting initiative and let your creativity shine!
