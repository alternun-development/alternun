Welcome to the Global ReFi Community! Today, we are excited to introduce you to **ALTERNUN Gold Backed Tokens (GBT)** and the innovative approach we are taking to address the challenges of traditional gold mining.

## Understanding the Problems

The current extractive model of gold mining has significant environmental and social consequences. Approximately 90% of extracted gold is used as a store of value, but the extraction process is fraught with issues:

- **Environmental Impact**: The mining process contributes to global warming, river pollution, deforestation, and loss of biodiversity. The carbon footprint from explosives, fossil fuel consumption, and energy-intensive smelting is substantial.
- **Social Issues**: Mining activities often lead to temporary employment, creating long-term social deficiencies in regions rich in minerals but lacking sustainable development.

This creates a win-lose economic relationship, where the community suffers while the environment is disrupted.

## What Do We Propose?

ALTERNUN aims to revolutionize this model through **Digital Gold Mining** in liquidity pools. This approach allows investors to safely store value while generating profits through decentralized decision-making. Our model promotes long-term value generation, environmental benefits, and social development.

### Liquidity Allocation

We have designed a clear allocation strategy for our liquidity pool:

- **Miner**: 8% - Protecting underground reserves.
- **Nation**: 2% - Ensuring environmental protection while collecting taxes.
- **Exploration**: 5% - Funding further exploration to increase reserves.
- **Community/Marketing**: 2.5% - Supporting community token holders.
- **Projects Feasibility**: 2.5% - Conducting feasibility studies for projects.
- **Recovery Pool**: 30% - Providing liquidity for extraction if necessary.
- **Projects**: 50% - Funding regenerative projects with 80% of profits shared with GBT holders.

### Liquidity Management

Our liquidity management is decentralized, allowing holders to participate in project elections and decide on investments. A portion of profits from projects is reinvested into the liquidity pool, creating a virtuous cycle of funding.

## How Digital Gold Mining Looks in the Long Run

Our regenerative approach ensures that the liquidity pool supports impactful projects, fostering environmental regeneration and community development. The profits generated will be reinvested, creating a sustainable business model.

## Process Required to Create a Digital Gold Mine

To establish a digital gold mining operation, we follow five essential steps:

1. **Legal Mine**: Ensure the mine has the necessary licenses.
2. **Exploration**: Gather data on the mine's potential.
3. **NI43-101 Report**: Conduct a thorough evaluation by a qualified person.
4. **Tokenization**: Determine the number of tokens based on the report.
5. **Liquidity Pool**: Create a pool to manage resources according to our ethos.

## Token Uses or Benefits

- **Protection Against Inflation**: GBTs are collateralized by gold mining reserves.
- **Governance**: Holders can vote on project developments.
- **Staking**: Participate in regenerative projects.
- **Special Features**: Enjoy unique rewards related to the mines and regenerated areas.

Join us in this journey towards a sustainable future with ALTERNUN and the Global ReFi Community!
